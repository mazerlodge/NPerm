POA - NPerm 

Goal - Create a python app that outputs possible numeric permutations for Kakuro puzzles. 

Sample Invocation: 
./nperm.py -t 12 -n 4 -s 4 -debug
	-t target value (12) 
	-n number of elements in result (in this case 4) 
	-s skip value (optional param), in this case skip the number 4 
	-debug optional parameter to output diagnostic information 


==== Activity Log - 201912 ====

12/28 (S) 
	- Initial version 
	- Added param for skip value as work around until systematic skipping can be added. 
	- Changed skip parameter to allow accepting a CSV List of values to skip 

12/29 (U) 
	- Add code to handle skipping without having to specify individual skip values 
	- Added branch Prematuer_Zero_Check
	- Detects where current candidate value would drive remainder to zero prematurely	
	- Incomplete solution, still misses t12n4 = 6, 3, 2, 1 (requires multiple skips) 
	- Created branch Auto_skip_single_digits (does as name implies) 
	- Created branch Auto_skip_all_combos, seems to resolve issue with missing some results with multi-skips
